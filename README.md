## 📋 Summary

🎾 This padel web application is designed for **amateur** and **semi-professional** players 🏆 looking to find the most suitable racket according to their characteristics and playing style.

The problem it solves is the **uncertainty when choosing a racket** ❓: many players buy the one used by a professional, even though it doesn't really adapt to their level or needs 🤔.

The application provides a **detailed catalog and intelligent comparator** 📊 that, based on user preferences and profile, recommends the most appropriate racket to improve their performance 📈 and avoid purchase decisions based solely on popularity ⭐.
